<h1>Markdown2Html (unfinished)</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>This is a project I\'ve made to help me learn OCaml, which I am studying at university.</p>
<p>It takes in a markdown file and then converts it to HTML code.</p>
<h2>Features</h2>
<p>So far, it works with:</p>
<ul><li>Bold text</li>
<li>Italic text</li>
<li>Headings</li>
<li>Unordered lists</li>
</ul><p></p>
<p>However, I plan on adding more features such as links and ordered lists soon.</p>
<h2>Using this project</h2>
<p>To use this project, fork it and run it in a terminal using `dune exec Markdown2Html [filepath]`.</p>
<p>(I will add to this section with a better way in the future)</p>
<h2>Demo</h2>
<p>This file is conveniently a markdown file.</p>
<p>To see this project in action, look at the README.html file, which is the output of the program when ran with this file\'s path as an argument.</p>
