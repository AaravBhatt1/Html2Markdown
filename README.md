# Html2Markdown (unfinished)
## Overview
This is a project I've made to help me learn OCaml, which I am studying at university.
It takes in a markdown file and then converts it to HTML code.
## Features
So far, it works with:
 * Bold text
 * Italic text
 * Headings
 * Unordered lists

However, I plan on adding more features such as links and ordered lists soon.
## Using this project
To use this project, fork it and run it in a terminal using `dune exec [filepath]`.
(I will add to this section with a better way in the future)
## Demo
This file is conveniently a markdown file.
To see this project in action, look at the README.html file, which is the output of the program when ran with this file's path as an argument.
